All credit for the actual deobfuscation engine goes to the original author.
My contribution is providing a simple, user-friendly interface and adding decompilation support.

[Lua Decompiler](https://luadec.metaworm.site/)

# Requirements
1. [.NET 8 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)


Upload your obfuscated .lua file (Moonsec only)

The process:

Deobfuscate the script

Decompile it using the [online decompiler](https://luadec.metaworm.site/)

Clean and format the output

Your final Decompiled & Cleaned .lua file will appear in the Deobfuscated folder.
